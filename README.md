## Getting started 
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

* You will need to install Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) plugin since there is no backend server running in order to enable it. I use [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
* An API key from [footbal-data](http://www.football-data.org/) or you can run this project locally by setting localjson to true in the environment.ts file.

### Installing

```
Run npm install to tnstall the dependencies in the local node_modules folder
```

```
Setup your enviroment.ts file:
- authToken: 'yourAPIKey'
- api_url: ' 'http://api.football-data.org/v1/'
- localjson: boolean  // false => use API | true => test with local json
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Built with
* [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular) - Frontend MVC framework
